abstract: Clinical studies often require understanding elements of a patient’s narrative
  that exist only in free text clinical notes. To transform notes into structured
  data for downstream use, these elements are commonly extracted and normalized to
  medical vocabularies. In this work, we audit the performance of and indicate areas
  of improvement for state-of-the-art systems. We find that high task accuracies for
  clinical entity normalization systems on the 2019 n2c2 Shared Task are misleading,
  and underlying performance is still brittle. Normalization accuracy is high for
  common concepts (95.3%), but much lower for concepts unseen in training data (69.3%).
  We demonstrate that current approaches are hindered in part by inconsistencies in
  medical vocabularies, limitations of existing labeling schemas, and narrow evaluation
  techniques. We reformulate the annotation framework for clinical entity extraction
  to factor in these issues to allow for robust end-to-end system benchmarking. We
  evaluate concordance of annotations from our new framework between two annotators
  and achieve a Jaccard similarity of 0.73 for entity recognition and an agreement
  of 0.83 for entity normalization. We propose a path forward to address the demonstrated
  need for the creation of a reference standard to spur method development in entity
  recognition and normalization.
