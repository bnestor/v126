abstract: Modern deep learning algorithms geared towards clinical adaption usually
  rely on a large amount of high fidelity labeled data. Low-resource settings pose
  challenges like acquiring high fidelity data and becomes the bottleneck for developing
  artificial intelligence applications. Ultrasound images, stored in Digital Imaging
  and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) format, have additional metadata data corresponding
  to ultrasound image parameters and medical exams. In this work, we leverage DICOM
  metadata from ultrasound images to help learn representations of the ultrasound
  image. We demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the approaches without
  using metadata across a variety of downstream tasks.
