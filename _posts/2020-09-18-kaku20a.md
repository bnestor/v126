abstract: Recovery after stroke is often incomplete, but rehabilitation training may
  potentiate recovery by engaging endogenous neuroplasticity. In preclinical models
  of stroke, high doses of rehabilitation training are required to restore functional
  movement to the affected limbs of animals. In humans, however, the necessary dose
  of training to potentiate recovery is not known. This ignorance stems from the lack
  of objective, pragmatic approaches for measuring training doses in rehabilitation
  activities. Here, to develop a measurement approach, we took the critical first
  step of automatically identifying functional primitives, the basic building block
  of activities. Forty-eight individuals with chronic stroke performed a variety of
  rehabilitation activities while wearing inertial measurement units (IMUs) to capture
  upper body motion. Primitives were identified by human labelers, who labeled and
  segmented the associated IMU data. We performed automatic classification of these
  primitives using machine learning. We designed a convolutional neural network model
  that outperformed existing methods. The model includes an initial module to compute
  separate embeddings of different physical quantities in the sensor data. In addition,
  it replaces batch normalization (which performs normalization based on statistics
  computed from the training data) with instance normalization (which uses statistics
  computed from the test data). This increases robustness to possible distributional
  shifts when applying the method to new patients. With this approach, we attained
  an average classification accuracy of 70%. Thus, using a combination of IMU-based
  motion capture and deep learning, we were able to identify primitives automatically.
  This approach builds towards objectively-measured rehabilitation training, enabling
  the identification and counting of functional primitives that accrues to a training
  dose.
