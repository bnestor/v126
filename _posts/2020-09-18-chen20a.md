abstract: Kernel survival analysis methods predict subject-specific survival curves
  and times using information about which training subjects are most similar to a
  test subject. These most similar training subjects could serve as forecast evidence.
  How similar any two subjects are is given by the kernel function. In this paper,
  we present the first neural network framework that learns which kernel functions
  to use in kernel survival analysis. We also show how to use kernel functions to
  construct prediction intervals of survival time estimates that are statistically
  valid for individuals similar to a test subject. These prediction intervals can
  use any kernel function, such as ones learned using our neural kernel learning framework
  or using random survival forests. Our experiments show that our neural kernel survival
  estimators are competitive with a variety of existing survival analysis methods,
  and that our prediction intervals can help compare different methodsâ€™ uncertainties,
  even for estimators that do not use kernels. In particular, these prediction interval
  widths can be used as a new performance metric for survival analysis methods.
