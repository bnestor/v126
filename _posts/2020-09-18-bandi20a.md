abstract: 'We propose a holistic framework based on state-of-the-art methods in Machine
  Learning and Optimization to prescribe influenza vaccine composition that are specific
  to a region, or a country based on historical data concerning the rates of circulation
  of predominant viruses. First, we develop a tensor completion formulation to predict
  rates of circulation of viruses for the next season based on historical data. Then,
  taking into account the uncertainty in the predicted rates of circulation of predominant
  viruses, we propose a novel robust prescriptive framework for selecting suitable
  strains for each subtypes of the flu virus: Influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B viruses
  for production. Finally, we train optimal regression trees to predict efficacy of
  the prescribed vaccine in terms of both morbidity and mortality rates using a set
  of weighted distances between the vaccine-strain and the actual circulating viruses
  during a flu season for each subtypes of the flu virus. Through numerical experiments,
  we show that our proposed vaccine compositions could potentially lower morbidity
  by 11-14% and mortality by 8-11% over vaccine compositions proposed by World Health
  Organization (WHO) for Northern hemisphere, and lower morbidity by 8-10% and mortality
  by 6-9% over vaccine compositions proposed by U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
  for USA, and finally, lower morbidity by 10-12% and mortality by 9-11% over vaccine
  compositions proposed by European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Europe.'
