abstract: In Europe and North America, more homogeneous virus types and the relatively
  high availability of sequencing technologies have helped transform HIV from a life-threatening
  disease to a manageable chronic condition. However, modern therapies have been less
  successful in managing HIV in Africa, where there is more viral heterogeneity and
  access to sequencing is much less available. In this work, we present a novel mixture
  based approach that uses a deep information bottleneck to transfer patterns learned
  from European HIV cohorts where genomic data is readily available to African patients
  where no such data is available. We demonstrate its utility for optimising treatments
  for the first time in a set of HIV patients in Africa, and note how this approach
  may be applicable to many other scenarios where a variable is measured in some population
  but is missing from the target population.
