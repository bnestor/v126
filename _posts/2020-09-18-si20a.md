abstract: 'Small and imbalanced datasets commonly seen in healthcare represent a challenge
  when training classifiers based on deep learning models. So motivated, we propose
  a novel framework based on BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
  for Biomedical TextMining). Specifically, (i) we introduce Label Embeddings for
  Self-Attention in each layer of BERT, which we call LESA-BERT, and (ii) by distilling
  LESA-BERT to smaller variants, we aim to reduce over fitting and model size when
  working on small datasets. As an application, our framework is utilized to build
  a model for patient portal message triage that classifies the urgency of a message
  into three categories: non-urgent, medium and urgent. Experiments demonstrate that
  our approach can outperform several strong baseline classifiers by a significant
  margin of 4.3% in terms of macro F1 score. The code for this project is publicly
  available at https://github.com/shijing001/text_classifiers'
