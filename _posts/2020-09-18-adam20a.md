abstract: There is much hope for the positive impact of machine learning on healthcare.
  In fact, several ML methods are already used in everyday clinical practice, but
  the effect of adopting imperfect predictions from an ML system on model performance
  over time is unknown. Clinicians changing their decisions based on an imperfect
  ML system changes the underlying probability distribution P(Y ) of future data,
  where Y is the outcome. This effect has not been carefully studied to date. In this
  work we tackle the problem of model predictions influencing future labels (which
  we refer to as the feedback loop) by considering several supervised learning scenarios,
  and show that unlike in the no-feedback-loop setting, if clinicians fully trust
  the model (100% adoption of the predicted label) the false positive rate (FPR) grows
  uncontrollably with the number of updates. We simulate the feedback loop problem
  on a real-world ICU data (MIMIC-IV v0.1) as the distribution shifts over time. Among
  our scenarios, we consider how the clinicianâ€™s trust in the model over time impacts
  the magnitude of the FPR increase due to a feedback loop. Finally, we propose mitigating
  solutions to the observed model degradation using heuristics that discard potentially
  incorrectly labeled samples. We hope that our work draws attention to the existence
  of the feedback-loop problem resulting in both theoretical and practical advances
  for ML in healthcare.
