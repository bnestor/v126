abstract: Identifying causal relationships for a treatment intervention is a fundamental
  problem in health sciences. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the
  gold standard for identifying causal relationships. However, recent advancements
  in the theory of causal inference based on the foundations of structural causal
  models (SCMs) have allowed the identification of causal relationships from observational
  data, under certain assumptions. Survival analysis provides standard measures, such
  as the hazard ratio, to quantify the effects of an intervention. While hazard ratios
  are widely used in clinical and epidemiological studies for RCTs, a principled approach
  does not exist to compute hazard ratios for observational studies with SCMs. In
  this work, we review existing approaches to compute hazard ratios as well as their
  causal interpretation, if it exists. We also propose a novel approach to compute
  hazard ratios from observational studies using backdoor adjustment through SCMs
  and do-calculus. Finally, we evaluate the approach using experimental data for Ewingâ€™s
  sarcoma.
