abstract: Conversations between patients and providers in clinical settings provide
  a source of natural language data that may reflect and correlate with the patientsâ€™
  experience and response to the treatment they are receiving. When analyzing utterances
  in such conversations, it is not sufficient to consider each sentence in isolation,
  since its context may play a role in determining its semantic meaning. Recently,
  contextual information in natural language documents has been modeled using various
  techniques, such as recurrent neural networks with latent variables, or neural networks
  with attention mechanisms. In this paper, we present UnsuPerviSed conText AuGmEntation
  (Upstage), a classification framework that relies on both local and global contextual
  information from different sources. Upstage uses transformer models with pretrained
  language models and joint sentence representation to solve the task of classifying
  health topics in patient-provider conversations. In addition, Upstage leverages
  unlabeled corpora for pretraining and data augmentation to provide additional context,
  which leads to improved classification performance.
