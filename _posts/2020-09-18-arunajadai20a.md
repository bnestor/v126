abstract: Linking secondary clinical data with patient-reported data at the patient-level
  brings together a comprehensive view of the patient but sample sizes can be a challenge.
  This study demonstrates the fusion of Patient Reported Outcomes in surveys with
  clinical data in claims enabling the study of associations between quality of life
  and disease-treatment interactions at scale especially for rare diseases. In this
  work, we show the ability to implement data fusion in a disease agnostic way thereby
  enabling the use of more advanced machine learning algorithms on larger data sets,
  while still being able to use the resulting fused data to perform disease specific
  analysis. This is in contrast to usual approaches where the data fusion might be
  attempted on disease specific data sets which can be too small to be amenable to
  analysis by advanced methods. The proposed data fusion methodology circumvents some
  of the assumptions typically imposed on the data fusion process that are untestable
  and usually invalid by taking advantage of the subset of the data that can be linked
  in the two data sources.
