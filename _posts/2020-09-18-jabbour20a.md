title: 'Deep Learning Applied to Chest X-Rays: Exploiting and Preventing Shortcuts'
abstract: 'While deep learning has shown promise in improving the automated diagnosis
  of disease based on chest X-rays, deep networks may exhibit undesirable behavior
  related to short-cuts. This paper studies the case of spurious class skew in which
  patients with a particular attribute are spuriously more likely to have the outcome
  of interest. For instance, clinical protocols might lead to a dataset in which patients
  with pacemakers are disproportionately likely to have congestive heart failure.
  This skew can lead to models that take shortcuts by heavily relying on the biased
  attribute. We explore this problem across a number of attributes in the context
  of diagnosing the cause of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Applied to chest
  X-rays, we show that i) deep nets can accurately identify many patient attributes
  including sex (AUROC = 0.96) and age (AUROC 0.90), ii) they tend to exploit correlations
  between such attributes and the outcome label when learning to predict a diagnosis,
  leading to poor performance when such correlations do not hold in the test population
  (e.g., everyone in the test set is male), and iii) a simple transfer learning approach
  is surprisingly effective at preventing the shortcut and promoting good generalization
  performance. On the task of diagnosing congestive heart failure based on a set of
  chest X-rays skewed towards older patients (age $\geq$ 63), the proposed approach
  improves generalization over standard training from 0.66 (95% CI: 0.54-0.77) to
  0.84 (95% CI: 0.73-0.92) AUROC. While simple, the proposed approach has the potential
  to improve the performance of models across populations by encouraging reliance
  on clinically relevant manifestations of disease, i.e., those that a clinician would
  use to make a diagnosis.'
