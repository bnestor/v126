abstract: Survival function estimation is used in many disciplines, but it is most
  common in medical analytics in the form of the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Sensitive
  data (patient records) is used in the estimation without any explicit control on
  the information leakage, which is a significant privacy concern. We propose a first
  differentially private estimator of the survival function and show that it can be
  easily extended to provide differentially private confidence intervals and test
  statistics without spending any extra privacy budget. We further provide extensions
  for differentially private estimation of the competing risk cumulative incidence
  function, Nelson-Aalenâ€™s estimator for the hazard function, etc. Using eleven real-life
  clinical datasets, we provide empirical evidence that our proposed method provides
  good utility while simultaneously providing strong privacy guarantees.
