abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide vital contextual information to
  radiologists and other physicians when making a diagnosis. Unfortunately, because
  a given patient’s record may contain hundreds of notes and reports, identifying
  relevant information within these in the short time typically allotted to a case
  is very difficult. We propose and evaluate models that extract relevant text snippets
  from patient records to provide a rough case summary intended to aid physicians
  considering one or more diagnoses. This is hard because direct supervision (i.e.,
  physician annotations of snippets relevant to specific diagnoses in medical records)
  is prohibitively expensive to collect at scale. We propose a distantly supervised
  strategy in which we use groups of International Classification of Diseases (ICD)
  codes observed in ‘future’ records as noisy proxies for ‘downstream’ diagnoses.
  Using this we train a transformer-based neural model to perform extractive summarization
  conditioned on potential diagnoses. This model defines an attention mechanism that
  is conditioned on potential diagnoses (queries) provided by the diagnosing physician.
  We train (via distant supervision) and evaluate variants of this model on EHR data
  from Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and MIMIC-III (the latter to facilitate
  reproducibility). Evaluations performed by radiologists demonstrate that these distantly
  supervised models yield better extractive summaries than do unsupervised approaches.
  Such models may aid diagnosis by identifying sentences in past patient reports that
  are clinically relevant to a potential diagnosis. Code is available at https://github.com/dmcinerney/ehr-extraction-models.
