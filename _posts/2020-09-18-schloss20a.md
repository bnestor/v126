abstract: 'Summaries generated from medical conversations can improve recall and understanding
  of care plans for patients and reduce documentation burden for doctors. Recent advancements
  in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU) offer
  potential solutions to generate these summaries automatically, but rigorous quantitative
  baselines for benchmarking research in this domain are lacking. In this paper, we
  bridge this gap for two tasks: classifying utterances from medical conversations
  according to (i) the SOAP section and (ii) the speaker role. Both are fundamental
  building blocks along the path towards an end-to-end, automated SOAP note for medical
  conversations. We provide details on a dataset that contains human and ASR transcriptions
  of medical conversations and corresponding machine learning optimized SOAP notes.
  We then present a systematic analysis in which we adapt an existing deep learning
  architecture to the two aforementioned tasks. The results suggest that modelling
  context in a hierarchical manner, which captures both word and utterance level context,
  yields substantial improvements on both classification tasks. Additionally, we develop
  and analyze a modular method for adapting our model to ASR output.'
