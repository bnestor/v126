abstract: Event time models predict occurrence times of an event of interest based
  on known features. Recent work has demonstrated that neural networks achieve state-of-the-art
  event time predictions in biomedical applications, where event time models are frequently
  used, as well as a variety of other settings. However, standard event time models
  suppose that the event occurs, eventually, in all cases. Consequently, no distinction
  is made between a) the probability of event occurrence, and b) the predicted time
  of occurrence. This distinction is critical when predicting medical diagnoses as
  well as social media posts, equipment defects, and other events that or may not
  occur; and for which the features affecting a) may be different from those affecting
  b). In this work, we develop a conditional event time model that distinguishes between
  these components, implement it as a neural network with a binary stochastic layer
  representing nite event occurrence, and show how it may be learned from right-censored
  event times via maximum likelihood estimation. Results demonstrate improved event
  occurrence and event time predictions on synthetic data, medical events (MIMIC-III),
  and social media posts (Reddit), including posts related to mental health, comprising
  21 total prediction tasks.
