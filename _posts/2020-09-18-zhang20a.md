abstract: Blood pressure monitoring is an essential component of hypertension management
  and in the prediction of associated comorbidities. Blood pressure is a dynamic vital
  sign with frequent changes throughout a given day. Capturing blood pressure remotely
  and frequently (also known as ambulatory blood pressure monitoring) has traditionally
  been achieved by measuring blood pressure at discrete intervals using an inflatable
  cuff. However, there is growing interest in developing a cuffless ambulatory blood
  pressure monitoring system to measure blood pressure continuously. One such approach
  is by utilizing bioimpedance sensors to build regression models. A practical problem
  with this approach is that the amount of data required to confidently train such
  a regression model can be prohibitive. In this paper, we propose the application
  of the domain-adversarial training neural network (DANN) method on our multitask
  learning (MTL) blood pressure estimation model, allowing for knowledge transfer
  between subjects. Our proposed model obtains average root mean square error (RMSE)
  of $4.80 \pm 0.74$ mmHg for diastolic blood pressure and $7.34 \pm 1.88$ mmHg for
  systolic blood pressure when using three minutes of training data, $4:64 \pm 0.60$
  mmHg and $7.10 \pm 1.79$ respectively when using four minutes of training data,
  and $4.48 \pm 0.57$ mmHg and $6.79 \pm 1:70$ respectively when using five minutes
  of training data. DANN improves training with minimal data in comparison to both
  directly training and to training with a pretrained model from another subject,
  decreasing RMSE by 0.19 to 0.26 mmHg (diastolic) and by 0.46 to 0.67 mmHg (systolic)
  in comparison to the best baseline models. We observe that four minutes of training
  data is the minimum requirement for our framework to exceed ISO standards within
  this cohort of patients.
