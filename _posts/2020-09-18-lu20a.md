abstract: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, affecting about
  1% of the population at all ages. Detecting the development of epilepsy, i.e., epileptogenesis
  (EPG), before any seizures occur could allow for early interventions and potentially
  more effective treatments. Here, we investigate if modern machine learning (ML)
  techniques can detect EPG from intra-cranial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings
  prior to the occurrence of any seizures by a time frame of days or even weeks. We
  study a common form of epilepsy called mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE). Specifically,
  we use a rodent mTLE model where EPG is triggered by electrical stimulation of the
  brain, which induces hippocampal damages that resemble those in human patients.
  We propose a ML framework for EPG identification, which combines a deep convolutional
  neural network (CNN) with a prediction aggregation method to obtain the final classification
  decision. Specifically, the neural network is trained to distinguish five second
  segments of EEG recordings taken from either the pre-stimulation period or the post-stimulation
  period. Due to the gradual development of epilepsy, there is enormous overlap of
  the EEG patterns before and after the stimulation. Hence, a prediction aggregation
  process is introduced, which pools predictions over a longer period. By aggregating
  predictions over one hour, our approach achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of
  0.99 on the EPG detection task. This demonstrates the potential of ML for EPG prediction
  from EEG recordings.
