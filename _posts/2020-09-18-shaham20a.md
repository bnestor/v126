abstract: We propose a novel reinforcement learning-based approach for adaptive and
  iterative feature selection. Given a masked vector of input features, a reinforcement
  learning agent iteratively selects certain features to be unmasked, and uses them
  to predict an outcome when it is sufficiently confident. The algorithm makes use
  of a novel environment setting, corresponding to a non-stationary Markov Decision
  Process. A key component of our approach is a guesser network, trained to predict
  the outcome from the selected features and parametrizing the reward function. Applying
  our method to a national survey dataset, we show that it not only outperforms strong
  baselines when requiring the prediction to be made based on a small number of input
  features, but is also highly more interpretable. Our code is publicly available
  at https://github.com/ushaham/adaptiveFS.
