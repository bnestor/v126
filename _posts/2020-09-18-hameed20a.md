abstract: Managing a chronic disease like Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is both challenging
  and time consuming, but new technologies that allow continuous measurement of glucose
  and delivery of insulin have led to significant improvements. The development of
  an artificial pancreas (AP), which algorithmically determines insulin dosing and
  delivers insulin in a fully automated way, may transform T1D care but it is not
  yet widely available. Patient-led alternatives, like the Open Artificial Pancreas
  (OpenAPS), are being used by hundreds of individuals and have also led to a dramatic
  increase in the availability of patient generated health data (PGHD). All APs require
  an accurate forecast of blood glucose (BG). While there have been efforts to develop
  better forecasts and apply new ML techniques like deep learning to this problem,
  methods are often tested on small controlled datasets that do not indicate how they
  may perform in reality - and the most advanced methods have not always outperformed
  the simplest. We introduce a rigorous comparison of BG forecasting using both a
  small controlled research dataset and large heterogeneous PGHD. Our comparison advances
  the state of the art in BG forecasting by providing insight into how methods may
  fare when moving beyond small controlled studies to real-world use.
