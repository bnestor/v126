abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an insidious progressive neurodegenerative disease
  resulting in impaired cognition, dementia, and eventual death. At the earliest stages
  of the disease, decline in multiple cognitive domains including speech and eye movements
  occurs, and worsens with disease progression. Therefore, investigating speech and
  eye movements is promising as a non-invasive method for early classification of
  AD. While related work has investigated AD classification using speech collected
  during spontaneous speech tasks, no prior research has studied the utility of eye
  movements and their combination with speech for this classification task. In this
  paper, we present classification experiments with speech and eye movement data collected
  from 68 memory clinic patients (with a diagnosis of AD, mixed dementia, mild cognitive
  impairment, or subjective memory complaints) and 73 healthy volunteers completing
  the Cookie Theft picture description task. We show that eye tracking data is predictive
  of AD in a patient versus control classification task (AUC = .73). Furthermore,
  we show that using eye tracking data for this predictive task is complementary to
  using speech alone, as combining both modalities yields to the best classification
  performance (AUC=.80). Our results suggest that eye tracking is a useful modality
  for classification of AD, most promising when considered as an additional noninvasive
  modality to speech-based classification.
