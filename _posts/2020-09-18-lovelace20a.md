abstract: Problem lists are intended to provide clinicians with a relevant summary
  of patient medical issues and are embedded in many electronic health record systems.
  Despite their importance, problem lists are often cluttered with resolved or currently
  irrelevant conditions. In this work, we develop a novel end-to-end framework that
  first extracts diagnosis and procedure information from clinical notes and subsequently
  uses the extracted medical problems to predict patient outcomes. This framework
  is both more performant and more interpretable than existing models used within
  the domain, achieving an AU-ROC of 0.710 for bounceback readmission and 0.869 for
  in-hospital mortality occurring after ICU discharge. We identify risk factors for
  both readmission and mortality outcomes and demonstrate that our framework can be
  used to develop dynamic problem lists that present clinical problems along with
  their quantitative importance. We conduct a qualitative user study with medical
  experts and demonstrate that they view the lists produced by our framework favorably
  and find them to be a more effective clinical decision support tool than a strong
  baseline.
