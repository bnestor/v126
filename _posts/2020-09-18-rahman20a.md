title: Phenotyping with Prior Knowledge using Patient Similarity
abstract: 'Prior medical knowledge, like the relationships between diseases or treatments
  and their corresponding risk factors are widely available in electronic health records
  (EHR), can be generated by domain experts, and extracted from knowledge graphs.
  Although informative for predictive modeling tasks, most of the patient-specific
  knowledge in EHR are not utilized because of practical constraints on data availability
  or cost of acquiring the data to make inferences. We present a method to learn from
  prior knowledge using a mixture of experts model where gating probabilities are
  tuned by an adjacency matrix created using side information available during training,
  like comorbidities, interventions, outcomes, vital signs and laboratory measurements.
  The adjacency matrix of a nearest neighbor graph is used to discover subgroups of
  intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Experts are shown to specialize based on how
  patients are grouped in the adjacency matrix on two real-world decision support
  tasks: predicting hemodynamic interventions and stratifying patients at risk for
  developing a sustained period of hypoxemia. The proposed prior knowledge-guided
  learning (PKL) model discovers clinically meaningful cohorts in patients with respiratory
  compromise that match well known sub-phenotypes described in the literature.'
