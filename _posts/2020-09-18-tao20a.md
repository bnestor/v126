abstract: Accurate anti-cancer drug recommendations and the identification of essential
  biomarkers for this task are crucial to precision oncology. Large-scale drug response
  assays on cancer cell lines provide a potential way to understand the interplay
  of drugs and cancer cells. In this work, we present CADRE (Contextual Attention-based
  Drug REsponse), a model that accurately infers the response of cancer cell lines
  to a panel of candidate compounds based on the omics profiles, such as gene expressions,
  of cancer cells. CADRE builds on the framework of collaborative filtering, which
  provides robustness to the noise of biological data by leveraging similarities within
  drugs and cell lines. It utilizes the contextual attention mechanism to identify
  informative biomarkers of these cell lines, which boosts prediction accuracy and
  affords interpretability of results. In addition, CADRE incorporates external knowledge
  of drug target pathways and co-expression patterns of genes to further improve feature
  representations and model performance. Comprehensive evaluations of CADRE and competing
  models on two large-scale pharmacogenomic datasets show its superiority in both
  prediction performance and interpretability. CADRE identifies as vital biomarkers
  genes related to intracellular vesicles and signaling receptor binding, shedding
  light on its translational potential in the clinical practice of cancer treatment.
