abstract: Rotator Cuff Tears (RCTs) are a common injury among people who are middle-aged
  or older. For effective diagnosis of RCTs, orthopedic surgeons typically need to
  have access to both shoulder Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and proton density-weighted
  imaging. However, the generation and interpretation of such comprehensive image
  information is labor intensive, and thus time consuming and costly. Although computer-aided
  diagnosis can help in mitigating the aforementioned issues, no computational tools
  are currently available for diagnosing RCTs. Therefore, we introduce a computational
  approach towards RCT diagnosis in this paper, leveraging end-to-end learning by
  applying a deep convolutional neural network to shoulder MRI scans. Given that these
  shoulder MRI scans are 3-D by nature and highly biased towards normal shoulders,
  with only 6.6% of the available shoulder MRI scans containing partial-thickness
  tears, we made use of two tools to enhance our deep convolutional neural network.
  First, to enable the utilization of sequential information available in the 3-D
  MRI scans, we integrated a weighted linear combination layer. Second, to mitigate
  the presence of class imbalance, we adopted weighted cross-entropy loss. That way,
  we were able to obtain a diagnostic accuracy of 87% and an M-AUC score of 97%, outperforming
  a baseline of human annotators (diagnostic accuracy of 76% and an M-AUC score of
  81%). In addition, we were able to outperform several approaches using conventional
  machine learning techniques. Finally, to facilitate further research efforts and
  ease of benchmarking, we make our dataset of 2,447 shoulder MRI scans publicly available.
