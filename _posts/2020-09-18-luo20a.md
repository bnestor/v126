abstract: Molecular mechanisms are important to inform targeted intervention and are
  often encoded in gene sets or pathways. Existing machine learning approaches often
  face challenges in simultaneously reducing the high dimensionality and learning
  effective features that are discriminative in predicting the disease types with
  the usual presence of confounding variables. We aim to improve accuracy and interpretability
  of prediction models by introducing Supervised Confounding Aware Non-negative Matrix
  Factorization for Polygenic Risk Modeling (ScanMap) for genetic studies. ScanMap
  selects informative groups of genes that embody multiple interacting molecular functions
  by using a supervised model that integrates both groups of genes and confounding
  variables in predicting disease type and status. The learned groups of genes reflect
  interacting molecular mechanisms, which are suitable features for polygenic risk
  modeling. These learned features are then used in training a softmax classifier
  for disease type and status prediction. We evaluated ScanMap against multiple state-of-the-art
  unsupervised and supervised matrix factorization models using large scale NGS datasets.
  ScanMap outperformed all comparison models significantly (p < 0:05). Feature analysis
  was performed to illuminate the insights and benefits of gene groups learned by
  ScanMap in disease risk prediction.
