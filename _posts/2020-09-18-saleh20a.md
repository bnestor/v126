abstract: Clinical Machine Learning (ML) is a rapidly-growing field due to the digitization
  of hospital records, recent advances in ML techniques, and the ability to leverage
  increasing computational power for large and complex models. The high stakes and
  often unintuitive nature of clinical data make effective collaboration between clinicians
  and ML researchers one of the most important aspects of working in this interdisciplinary
  space. However, there are few resources codifying best practices for collaboration
  on Clinical ML projects. In this paper, we interviewed 18 experts in the Clinical
  ML field and distilled their advice and experiences into a list of questions (a
  Clinical Collabsheet) ML scientists and clinicians can use to promote effective
  discussion when working on a new project. We intend this for a broad audience as
  checklist of discussion points to hit at a kickoff meeting. This resource will enable
  more successful partnerships in Clinical ML with improved interdisciplinary communication
  and organization.
