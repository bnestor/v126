abstract: Current approaches to developing a generalized automated sleep staging method
  rely on constructing a large labeled training and test corpora by leveraging electroencephalograms
  (EEGs) from different individuals. However, data in the training set may exhibit
  changes in the EEG pattern that are very different from the data in the test set
  due to inherent inter-subject variability, heterogeneity of acquisition hardware,
  different montage choices and different recording environments. Training an algorithm
  on such data without accounting for this diversity can lead to underperformance.
  In order to solve this issue, different methods are investigated for learning an
  invariant representation across all individuals in datasets. However, all parts
  of the corpora are not equally transferable. Therefore, forcefully aligning the
  nontransferable data may lead to a negative impact on the overall performance. Inspired
  by how clinicians manually label sleep stages, this paper proposes a method based
  on adversarial training along with attention mechanisms to extract transferable
  information across individuals from different datasets and pay attention to more
  important or relevant channels and transferable parts of data, simultaneously. Using
  two large public EEG databases - 994 patient EEGs (6,561 hours of data) from the
  Physionet 2018 Challenge (P18C) database and 5,793 patients (42,560 hours) EEGs
  from Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) - we demonstrate that adversarially learning
  a network with attention mechanism, significantly boosts performance compared to
  state-of-the-art deep learning approaches in the cross-dataset scenario. By considering
  the SHHS as the training set, the proposed method improves, on average, precision
  from 0.72 to 0.84, sensitivity from 0.74 to 0.85, and Cohenâ€™s Kappa coefficient
  from 0.64 to 0.80 for the P18C database.
