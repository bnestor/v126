abstract: We present a system that uses a learned autocompletion mechanism to facilitate
  rapid creation of semi-structured clinical documentation. We dynamically suggest
  relevant clinical concepts as a doctor drafts a note by leveraging features from
  both unstructured and structured medical data. By constraining our architecture
  to shallow neural networks, we are able to make these suggestions in real time.
  Furthermore, as our algorithm is used to write a note, we can automatically annotate
  the documentation with clean labels of clinical concepts drawn from medical vocabularies,
  making notes more structured and readable for physicians, patients, and future algorithms.
  To our knowledge, this system is the only machine learning-based documentation utility
  for clinical notes deployed in a live hospital setting, and it reduces keystroke
  burden of clinical concepts by 67% in real environments.
