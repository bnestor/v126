abstract: Deep neural networks (DNN) have shown remarkable success in the classification
  of physiological signals. In this study we propose a method for examining to what
  extent does a DNN’s performance rely on rediscovering existing features of the signals,
  as opposed to discovering genuinely new features. Moreover, we offer a novel method
  of "removing" a hand-engineered feature from the network’s hypothesis space, thus
  forcing it to try and learn representations which are different from known ones,
  as a method of scientific exploration. We then build on existing work in the field
  of interpretability, specifically class activation maps, to try and infer what new
  features the network has learned. We demonstrate this approach using ECG and EEG
  signals. With respect to ECG signals we show that for the specific task of classifying
  atrial fibrillation, DNNs are likely rediscovering known features. We also show
  how our method could be used to discover new features, by selectively removing some
  ECG features and "rediscovering" them. We further examine how could our method be
  used as a tool for examining scientific hypotheses. We simulate this scenario by
  looking into the importance of eye movements in classifying sleep from EEG. We show
  that our tool can successfully focus a researcher’s attention by bringing to light
  patterns in the data that would be hidden otherwise.
