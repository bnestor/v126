abstract: Precision medicineâ€™s slogan is "right drug - right patient - right time."
  Implicit in the slogan is "right dose"; however, determining the right dose for
  any one patient can be challenging when dose-response data are limited. Bayesian
  methods, with their ability to explicitly incorporate prior information to supplement
  limited data, have been proposed as a solution to this problem. Although Hamiltonian
  Monte Carlo (HMC) is a leading methodology for inference in Bayesian models because
  of its ability to capture posterior distributions with high fidelity, dose personalization
  studies commonly use simpler Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference methods. The impact
  of the choice of inference engine on dose decision-making has not been explored.
  To better understand this issue, we perform a simulation study characterizing the
  differences between inferences made via MAP and HMC for personalized dosing strategies.
  The simulation study uses a new Bayesian pharmacokinetic model for apixaban pharmacokinetics
  written in an open source Bayesian language; the model code and posterior summaries
  of all parameters will be publicly available. We demonstrate that the differences
  between HMC and MAP are non-trivial and can greatly affect the choices surrounding
  dose selection for personalized medicine.
